/*  As vectors are sparse, which means they contain a lot of zeroes and their is no point in multiplying the no by 0 becz the result is going to be zero. So we skip them
    an store the remaing in a hash table as {key, value} where key = index and value = actual value of element. We build hash table for bot the vectors and then multiply them

    How Dot Product actually works?
    [a1,b1,c1] . [a2,b2,c2] => [a1*a2,b1*b2,c1*c2] 
    i.e multiply with same position element of other vector 

    O(N) time
