/*  Given an integer array, find all the different possible increasing subsequences of the given array, and the length of an increasing subsequence should be at least 2.
    
    The idea is to basically explore all permutations, with the following constraints:
       - Only add elements to permutation vector (cur in my case) if:

    The element is greater than the last element in sequence, also we should not push the same elements within the same  dfs level, that's why we're using hash set over here.

    The unordered_set is used to avoid [4,6,7(1)] and [4,6,7(2)] in a same level when we dfs. But it will not skip [4,6,7(1),7(2)], because 7(2) is added in the next dfs level of [4,6,7(1)]. Every time we start a "next level dfs", we will initialize a new unordered_set.

    TC: O(2^N) and Space: O(N) due to recursion stack space. We have total N numbers, and we can pick it or not so that's why O(2^N)
    Worst case will occur when the numbers are in increasing order eg [3,4,7,9]  in this case there will be total 2^N - (N+1)
