/*  Reverse the nodes in group of K, and if number of nodes to reverse is less than K then leave it as it is.
    Idea is to reverse the entire group by swapping or reversing the direction of individual arrows b/w adjacent nodes.
    We'll use 3 pointers, [prev, curr, nex]  nex will always be one node ahead of curr, and we'll be reversing the direction of arraw b/w these 2 nodes

    TC: O(N) and Space: O(1)

    Input: 1->2->3->4->5 for K = 3, Output = 3->2->1->4->5
