//    1) Mark only odd numbers as true at first
//    2) Start iterating from i*i because all the numbers less than it has been already cancelled
//    3) In loop i as well as j will be odd, so instead of doing j+=i which will be even bcoz odd+odd=even
//      we can modify this as odd+even to yield odd becz we need to check odd numbes only that whether they are prime or not
