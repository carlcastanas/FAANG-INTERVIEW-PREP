/*  Idea is to build a hash map containing the freq of each character of T, and as we've to sort the string T based on ordering of S. Then we can just start over S, and add all elements
    which are also presnt in T. And later add all the reamining characters, that are still pedning to be added which were not present in string S.

    Note: S has no no repetitions, but not sure about T. (confirm from interviewer)
    TC: O(N+M) and O(1) Space

    Edge Cases: 
    1. Think of cases when 'S' has all distinct characters, but 'T' has repititions, so in such cases for any x which occurs before y in S, there shouldn't be an instance of it
                which comes after y in T.
                s = "cba"   t = "cdabcca"  =>  result = "cccbaad"
    2. Consider the case, when a particular character is present in 'S' but not in 'T' like  
                s = "cbxa"   t = "cdabcca"  =>  result = "cccbaad"
