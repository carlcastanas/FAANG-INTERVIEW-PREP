/* 
    Find whether there exists a cycle in linked list or not.
    One way is to strore the nodes in a hash-set and check whether the current node already exists in it or not.

    But we can solve this in constant space using 2 pointers(fast & slow). The fast pointer moves at twice speed and will eventually meet the slower one.
    
    TC: O(N) if no cycle & O(N+K) if cycle where K is length of cycle
